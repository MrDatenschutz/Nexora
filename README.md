# Nexora

Nexora is a selfmade search engine project for organizing files hosted on Private.Server. Since there's no JavaScript implemented jet, it does not process any of the data given. We also might add CSS-files in order to optimize our UI. At the moment, we're prioritizing to get our server-project working in order to build a filebase which we can search in. Thanks for checking out on our developments.

# About us

We (or I) are some high-schoolers who enjoy coding (or using AI for writing code that you wouldn't understand) and are building some projects to better our daily lives, our privacy or have more fun at school ;^)
